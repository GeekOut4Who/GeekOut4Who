- 👋 Hi, I’m @GeekOut4Who
- 👀 I’m interested in Gaming, VR/AR, Neural Networks, and all things tech and Doctor Who!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Unity and the fundamentals of VR development, while brushing up on my AI knowledge to eventually build my own neural networks.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to VR/AR development, game design, or anything at the intersection of AI and gaming. I'm also open to working with fellow gamers on Twitch content and tech-driven initiatives. 
- 📫 How to reach me: Connect with me on Twitch @GeekOut4Who or drop me a message here on Github.
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a Whovian with a passion for bending time and space—whether it's in a game or through code. My ultimate goal is to blend my love for gaming with cutting-edge tech to create something truly unique.
